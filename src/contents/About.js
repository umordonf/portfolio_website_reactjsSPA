                    I originally attended the University of Manitoba for Biochemistry but I instead left with a degree in Computer Science. I've always been fascinated with technology and realized the bio sciences and lab work were not for me. I graduated with a specialization in Networking and Security but I really just like problem solving. I like reading horror, I'm a decent home cook and I love Scrubs and strategy games.
